<main class="container"><h1>About Us</h1>
<p>MTTS Mission (Mother Tongue Translation Support Mission) exists to help Seventh-day Adventist Christian literature reach people in their own mother tongues. We are not a translation agency and we do not carry out translation work ourselves. Instead, MTTS Mission serves as a funding, stewardship, and facilitation mission, supporting independent language and translation committees who do the actual work within their own communities. Our role is to provide financial support, legal coverage, uphold agreed quality standards, encourage accountability and help implement projects with mission operations while respecting the linguistic ownership, cultural insight, and decision-making of each translation committee. We believe translation is strongest when it is led by native speakers and local communities. MTTS Mission works across languages, tribes, and regions, without belonging to any single group. We exist to serve the shared goal of making the Advent Truth accessible in the heart language of every people. By supporting community-led translation rather than centralising control, MTTS Mission seeks to promote unity, trust, and long-term sustainability in mother-tongue translation work.
